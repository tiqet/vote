# Banking-Grade Performance Benchmarks

## Overview

Comprehensive performance benchmarks for validating banking-grade security and timing attack resistance.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
cd benchmarks
cargo bench

# Run specific benchmarks suite
cargo bench crypto_operations
cargo bench voting_workflow  
cargo bench security_monitoring.rs

# Generate HTML reports
cargo bench -- --output-format html
```

## Benchmark Suites

### 1. Crypto Operations (`crypto_operations.rs`)
**Purpose:** Timing attack resistance validation

**Key Metrics:**
- **Voter hash generation:** < 1ms, consistent timing
- **Key operations:** Ed25519 performance baselines
- **Memory security:** Constant-time comparison validation
- **Rate limiting:** DoS protection overhead

**Critical Tests:**
- `timing_attack_resistance` - Must show consistent timing across different inputs
- `constant_time_eq` - Memory comparison timing validation
- `concurrent_operations` - Multi-threaded security validation

### 2. Voting Workflow (`voting_workflow.rs`)
**Purpose:** End-to-end performance validation

**Key Metrics:**
- **Token lifecycle:** < 5ms for issue/validate
- **Lock operations:** < 2ms for acquire/release
- **Complete workflow:** < 10ms end-to-end
- **Concurrent voting:** Linear scaling up to 100 voters

**Critical Tests:**
- `full_voting_process` - Complete banking workflow performance
- `concurrent_voting` - Multi-voter scalability
- `error_handling` - Consistent timing for invalid operations

### 3. Security Monitoring (`security_monitoring.rs`)
**Purpose:** Real-time threat detection performance

**Key Metrics:**
- **Event recording:** < 1ms per security event
- **Pattern analysis:** < 5ms for 1000 events
- **Incident detection:** < 100ms for complex correlation
- **Audit operations:** < 10ms for integrity verification

**Critical Tests:**
- `incident_management` - Automated response performance
- `concurrent_security` - High-load monitoring capability
- `audit_system_performance` - Compliance logging overhead

## Performance Targets

### Banking-Grade Requirements

| Operation | Target | Acceptable | Critical |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Voter Hash | < 1ms | < 2ms | < 5ms |
| Token Issue | < 5ms | < 10ms | < 20ms |
| Lock Acquire | < 2ms | < 5ms | < 10ms |
| Complete Vote | < 10ms | < 20ms | < 50ms |
| Security Event | < 1ms | < 2ms | < 5ms |
| Incident Analysis | < 100ms | < 200ms | < 500ms |

### Timing Attack Resistance

**Critical:** Operations with sensitive data MUST show consistent timing:

```
voter_hash_0: 850μs ± 10μs  ✅ Good
voter_hash_1: 851μs ± 12μs  ✅ Good  
voter_hash_2: 920μs ± 5μs   ⚠️  Investigate
voter_hash_3: 1200μs ± 50μs ❌ CRITICAL - Timing leak
```

**Thresholds:**
- **Good:** < 5% variation between operations
- **Warning:** 5-10% variation - investigate
- **Critical:** > 10% variation - timing attack risk

## Running Specific Tests

### Timing Attack Validation
```bash
# Focus on timing consistency
cargo bench timing_attack_resistance

# Check for timing variations
cargo bench constant_time_eq
```

### Performance Regression Detection
```bash
# Baseline measurement
cargo bench --save-baseline main

# After changes
cargo bench --baseline main
```

### Stress Testing
```bash
# High concurrency tests
cargo bench concurrent_voting
cargo bench concurrent_security

# Resource monitoring
cargo bench resource_monitoring
```

## Interpreting Results

### Good Performance Profile
```
crypto_operations/voter_hash/consistent_timing
                        time:   [847.23 μs 849.67 μs 852.45 μs]
                        change: [-1.2% +0.1% +1.5%] (p = 0.89 > 0.05)
                        No change in performance detected.
```

### Warning Signs
```
voting_workflow/full_voting_process  
                        time:   [15.234 ms 18.567 ms 22.891 ms]
                        change: [+15.2% +23.4% +31.7%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has regressed.
```

### Critical Issues
```
crypto_operations/timing_attack_resistance/voter_hash_4
                        time:   [2.1234 ms 2.3456 ms 2.5678 ms]
                        change: [+150.2% +165.4% +180.7%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Severe performance regression detected.
```

## Automation Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/benchmarks.yml
- name: Performance Regression Check
  run: |
    cd benchmarks
    cargo bench --baseline main -- --output-format json > results.json
    python analyze_performance.py results.json
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Check critical timing operations before commit
#!/bin/bash
cd benchmarks
cargo bench timing_attack_resistance --quiet
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Timing attack resistance failed - commit blocked"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Security Validation

### Critical Security Metrics

1. **Timing Consistency:**
   ```bash
   # Must pass: < 5% variation
   cargo bench timing_attack_resistance
   ```

2. **Memory Security:**
   ```bash
   # Constant-time operations
   cargo bench constant_time_eq
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   ```bash
   # DoS protection validation  
   cargo bench rate_limiting
   ```

4. **Concurrent Security:**
   ```bash
   # Multi-threaded safety
   cargo bench concurrent_operations
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### High Timing Variation
```bash
# Check system load
cargo bench --isolated

# Profile specific operation
cargo bench voter_hash -- --profile-time=5
```

### Performance Regression
```bash
# Compare with baseline
cargo bench --baseline previous -- --verbose

# Detailed analysis
cargo bench --output-format json | jq '.reason'
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
cargo bench --features=memory-profiling
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Benchmarks
1. Follow existing patterns in benchmark files
2. Include timing attack resistance tests for crypto operations
3. Test both success and error scenarios
4. Validate concurrent operation safety

### Performance Standards
- All crypto operations: timing attack resistant
- Authentication flows: < 10ms end-to-end
- Security monitoring: real-time (< 1ms event processing)
- Audit operations: < 10ms for compliance logging
